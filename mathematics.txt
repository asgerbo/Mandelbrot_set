Prerequisites for the Mandelbrot Set - before diving into the programming part of this.

The Mandelbrot Set is a two-dimensional set with a relatively simple mathematical formulation/structure. 

We can define the set on the complex plane, as the complex numbers c for the function f_c(x) = z^2 + c does not diverge to infinity when iterated from z = 0. 

The Mandelbrot Set have both stable, unstable and semi-stable points on the graph of possibilities. Meaning, we can zoom in on these semi-stable points that yield complex, and aesthetic appealing structures and fractal structures. 

We can define a decision boundary for which the Mandelbrot set either converges or diverges - it can be helpful for understanding to draw a 1-D plane, and show how the bounadries work in this case. On the 1-D plane, the boundary will be from [-1, 1], and when extended to 2-D planes, the boundary becomes a sphere. With the introduction of complex numbers, the iteration becomes the Mandelbrot Set. 

As a definition; The Mandelbrot Set is the set of values of c in the complex plane for which the orbit of the critical point z = 0 under iteration of the quadratic map; z_{n + 1} = z_n^2 + c remains bounded. Thus a complex number c is a member of the Mandelbrot Set if, when starting with z_0 = 0 and applying the iteration repeatedly, the absolute value of z_n remains bounded for all n > 0.

We will need an asortment of different packages. 

Initial thoughts; 

1. Class definition for addtion of complex numbers to some function.

2. Functions for mapping - coloring as well, since we do not want a binary plot of white + black

3. Vectorization and parallellization of inputs to improve computational ability - this comes in hand after the number generation has taken place

4. Class definition for the mandelbrot it self, this will help when calling the functions within the class to compute the and draw the mandelbrot in another program. 

5. Maybe have separate mandelbrot class and mandelbrot_explorer - one who computes and one who plots with specific parameters already set. 

6. Click & scroll interactively function. 

7. Function defining colors for the plot

8. Cartesian plane (this is just the 2-D plane). For expressional terms it would be better to include this than saying the 2-D plane.
